# Playwright Learning Roadmap - Lean & Risk-Driven Testing

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Aligned with:** Current project test strategy

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Master Playwright test automation using a **lean, risk-driven approach** focused on:
- Building fast, stable smoke test suites (<5 min)
- API contract testing and data validation
- Risk-first test prioritization
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Balancing automation with exploratory testing

---

## Phase 1 - Foundation & Quick Wins (Week 1)

### 1. **Playwright Basics**
- Read [Playwright Getting Started](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)
- Run existing tests in the project:
  ```bash
  npm test                    # All tests
  npm run test:smoke          # Smoke tests
  npm run test:api            # API tests
  npm run test:ui             # UI mode (visual)
  ```
- Explore `tests/ui/getting-started.spec.ts` in UI mode
- Practice core actions: `click`, `fill`, `waitForSelector`

### 2. **Understand the Project Structure**
- Review `docs/strategy/test-strategy.md` to understand the testing philosophy
- Explore `tests/smoke/` - critical flows (<5 min runtime target)
- Examine `tests/api/` - Restful Booker API tests
- Read `docs/strategy/user-journeys.md` for critical user paths

### 3. **Run & Understand Smoke Tests**

---

## Phase 4 - Exploratory & Charter-Based Testing (Week 4)

### 1. **Exploratory Testing Basics**
- Read `docs/charters/charter-template.md`
- Study the example: `docs/charters/example-checkout-charter.md`
- Learn time-boxed session techniques

### 2. **Session-Based Test Management**
- Conduct a 1-hour exploratory session on checkout flow
- Document findings using the charter template
- Balance automation vs. exploration

### 3. **Bug Discovery & Prioritization**
- Practice risk-based prioritization (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- Link bugs to failing automated tests
- Create test cases from exploratory findings

### ðŸŽ¯ **Week 4 Deliverable**
- Complete 1 charter-based exploratory session
- Document findings in `docs/charters/`
- Convert 1 finding into an automated test

---

## Phase 5 - Cross-Browser & Advanced Patterns (Week 5-6)

### 1. **Cross-Browser Testing**
- Configure tests for Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Review `tests/cross-browser/` directory
- Handle browser-specific quirks

### 2. **Selectors & Locators**
- Master `getByRole`, `getByTestId`, `getByText`
- Practice CSS and XPath selectors
- Use Playwright Inspector for selector debugging

### 3. **Fixtures & Page Objects**
- Create custom fixtures for authenticated sessions
- Build page object models for reusable components
- Share context between UI and API tests

### ðŸŽ¯ **Week 5-6 Deliverable**
- Write tests that run across 3 browsers
- Create 1 custom fixture for auth
- Build a page object for a critical flow

---

## Phase 6 - Performance & Release Process (Week 7-8)

### 1. **Release Checklist**
- Study `docs/strategy/release-checklist.md`
- Understand exit criteria for each stage (PR â†’ Staging â†’ Production)
- Practice pre-release validation steps

### 2. **Performance Baseline** (Optional/Future)
- Explore k6 for performance testing
- Measure Web Vitals with `page.evaluate()`
- Set up SLO alerts (p95 < 200ms for GET)

### 3. **Test Maintenance**
- Identify and fix flaky tests
- Refactor slow tests to meet <5 min smoke target
- Practice test debugging with traces and videos

### ðŸŽ¯ **Week 7-8 Deliverable**
- Execute the full release checklist for a mock release
- Identify and fix 1 flaky test
- Document lessons learned

## ðŸ§ª Hands-On Practice Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smoke tests, not complex regression tests
2. **Run Tests Often**: Use `npm run test:ui` for fast feedback
3. **Debug with Traces**: Enable trace viewer for failed tests
4. **Review Examples**: Read existing tests in `tests/` before writing new ones
5. **Ask Questions**: Reference the docs and community resources
6. **Keep It Fast**: Every test you write should respect the <5 min smoke target
7. **Think Risk-First**: Always ask "What's the business impact if this fails?"

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

> "Stay lean and risk-first, automate the critical path, and tighten the release ritual every week."

**Key Principles:**
- Smoke tests on every PR (<5 min)
- Risk-driven prioritization over 100% coverage
- Fast feedback loops over comprehensive suites
- Balance automation + exploratory testing

---

## âœ… Checkpoint Questions

After each phase, ask yourself:
- Can I write a test from scratch without referencing examples?
- Do I understand why this test matters for the business?
- Can I debug a failing test using traces/reports?
- Am I following the project's lean testing philosophy?

**Next Steps:** Start with Phase 1 and complete the Week 1 deliverable!
